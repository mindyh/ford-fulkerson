Implements Ford-Fulkerson to find max-flow, without fattest path heuristic. May tidy up code in the future, right now just using it to learn git/Github.


For input: 

  the first line reads in source, sink, number of nodes, and number of edges.
  
  the rest of the lines read in edges and weights, formatted like so: start_node end_node edge_weight
